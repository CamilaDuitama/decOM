# decOM: Similarity-based microbial source tracking of ancient oral samples using k-mer-based methods  
  
`decOM` is a high-accuracy microbial source tracking method that is suitable for contamination quantification in paleogenomics, namely the analysis of collections of possibly contaminated ancient oral metagenomic data sets. In simple words, if you want to know how contaminated your ancient oral metagenomic sample is, this tool will help  🧹🦷

## System requirements  
  
`decOM` has been developed and tested under a Linux environment and it only works in Linux-like systems.
It requires certain packages/tools in order to be installed/used:   
+ [miniconda3](https://conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  
  
## Installation  
  
Install `decOM` through conda:  
```  
git clone https://github.com/CamilaDuitama/decOM.git  
cd decOM  
conda env create -n decOM --file environment.yml  
conda deactivate
conda activate decOM  
```  
To make the ``decOM`` command available, it is advised to include the absolute path of `decOM` in your PATH environment variable by adding the following line to your `~/.bashrc` file:  
  
```  
export PATH=/absolute/path/to/decOM:${PATH}  
```  
  
## Before running decOM  
  
**BEFORE** running `decOM` you must first download the folder [decOM_sources.tar.gz](https://zenodo.org/record/6513520/files/decOM_sources.tar.gz) and decompress it. You can either follow the link or use wget (it has to be installed in your computer first):  
```  
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6513520/files/decOM_sources.tar.gz  
tar -xf decOM_sources.tar.gz
```  
If you did not use wget to download the matrix of sources and instead followed the link, make sure you know where the path to your file is and type it accordingly in the upcoming commands whenever `p_sources` is needed. 
  
## Test  
### One sink

You can test if `decOM` is working by using the aOral sample present in the `test/sample/` folder, ex: SRR13355807.   
```  
decOM -s SRR13355807 -p_sources decOM_sources/ -k tests/sample/SRR13355807.fof -mem 10GB -t 5 
```  
*Note*: The final memory allocated for each run of `decOM` will be your input in `-mem` times the number of cores (`-t`). In the previous run we used 10GB * 5 = 50 GB. It is recommended to run `decOM` with at least 10GB of memory and 1 core.

### Several sinks
You can test if `decOM` with several sinks by using the files inside `test/several_samples/` as follows: 
  ```  
decOM -p_sources decOM_sources/ -p_sinks tests/several_samples/sinks.txt -p_keys tests/several_samples/ -mem 10GB -t 5 
```  

`decOM`relies on `DASK` for parallelization. Once you start running `decOM`and the client is set, you can see the [diagnostic dashboard](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/dashboard.html) to follow the process and better tune parameters such as `-mem `and `-t`, make sure you can connect to your local host and visualise it here: http://127.0.0.1:8787/status 
  
## Output files  
`decOM` will output one .csv file with the k-mer counts and proportions, a folder with the vector representing the sample of interest, from now on called sink (s), and a barplot if indicated by the user.  
  
```  
decOM_output/  
├──decOM_output.csv 
├──result_plot_sinks.pdf 
├──result_plot_sinks.html 
├──{s}_vector/  
```  
The `decOM_output.csv` file is a dataframe that contains one row per sink. The columns correspond to the raw number of k-mers per source environment, 
the running time per sink, the sink name and the proportions. The result for the one sample explained before should look like this:


| Sediment/Soil | Skin | aOral | mOral | Unknown | Running time (s) | Sink | p_Sediment/Soil | p_Skin | p_aOral | p_mOral | p_Unknown | decOM_max |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |:----------------:| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | 
| 182 | 281 | 197859 | 37023 | 334 |196.7268| SRR13355807 | 0.0772 | 0.1192 | 83.9527 | 15.7091 | 0.1417 | aOral |

The `result_plot_sinks.pdf` and `result_plot_sinks.html` are static and interactive plots (respectively) for the proportions of source environments per sink.
The `{s}_vector/` folder is the output of kmtricks filter + kmtricks aggregate.

## Example  
  
You can use as input your fastq/fasta file from your own experiment, you can download an ancient oral sample of interest from the [AncientMetagenomeDir](https://github.com/SPAAM-community/AncientMetagenomeDir) or from the [SRA](https://sra-explorer.info/).  
The users of `decOM` can represent their own metagenomic sample as a presence/absence vector of k-mers using kmtricks. This sink can be compared against the collection of sources we have put together.  
  
Once you have downloaded the folder with the [matrix of sources](#before-running-decom) and the fastq file(s) of your sink(s), you have to create a `key.fof` file per sink.   
The `key.fof` has one line of text depending on your type of data:  

**-Single-end:**  
 `s : path/to/file/s_1.fastq.gz`  
  
**-Paired-end :**  
 `s : path/to/file/s_1.fastq.gz;  path/to/file/s_2.fastq.gz `  
  
*Note*: As `decOM` relies on [`kmtricks`](https://github.com/tlemane/kmtricks), you might use a FASTA or FASTQ format, gzipped or not, which means you have to change the `key.fof` file accordingly.  
  
Since you now have the fasta/fastq file of your sink, the folder with the matrix of sources and the key file, simply run decOM as follows:  

### Single sink

```decOM -s {SINK} -p_sources decOM_sources/ -k {KEY.FOF} -mem {MEMORY} -t {THREADS}```  

### Several sinks

If you want to assess the contamination of several sinks, you need one `key.fof` file per sink, and they must be inside the folder `p_sources`

```decOM -p_sinks {PATH_SINKS} -p_sources decOM_sources/ -p_keys {PATH_KEYS} -mem {MEMORY} -t {THREADS}```   

## Additional features 

### aOralOut:
This feature was thought for the users who prefered having mOral, Skin and Sediment/Soil samples as sources but no aOral samples. Once you download and unzip the new matrix of sources:

```
wget https://zenodo.org/record/6772124/files/aOralOut_sources.tar.gz
tar -xf aOralOut_sources.tar.gz
```

Simply run decOM-aOralOut as follows:

````
decOM-aOralOut -s SRR13355807 -p_sources aOralOut_sources/ -k tests/sample/SRR13355807.fof -mem 10GB -t 5 
````
